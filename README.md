## üìå Overview  
**Goal**: Develop a replicable method to document and analyse the iPlayer interface over time, identifying patterns in content prioritisation, UX design, and editorial strategy. The method was also designed to be easily adapted for other VOD services.  

**Key Achievements**:  
- Created the first continuous dataset of iPlayer's landing page (2+ years of daily scrapes).  
- Published findings in [*Critical Studies in Television*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17496020211024201) (2021) and [*MedieKultur*](https://tidsskrift.dk/mediekultur/article/view/122386) (2021).  
- Presented at 8 international conferences (2017-2023), including ECREA 2022 (√Örhus, Denmark), RIPE@2021 (Fribourg, Switzerland), and Critical Studies in Television (Edge Hill, UK).

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  
**Data Collection**:  
- Automated daily scrapes using [ParseHub](https://www.parsehub.com/) (capturing a wide range of data points including: titles, synopses, row and column positions, channels).  
- Collected daily snapshots at consistent times (9pm GMT) to account for diurnal variation in content.  

**Data Processing**:  
- Cleaned/combined daily CSV files using [R script](https://figshare.com/articles/software/R_Script_-_Cleaning_BBC_iPlayer_Interface_Data/13296437).  
- Output: Structured dataset for temporal analysis.

## üéØ Key Insights  
1. **Decline in Channel Branding**:  
   Channel affiliations dropped from near-ubiquitous to negligible over the sample data (2+ years), indicating iPlayer's pivot toward a more platform agnostic model of unbranded content curation.  

2. **Consistent Genre Placement**:  
   Heatmap analysis revealed that selected genres (e.g., film and sport) appeared in a higher concentration in selected rows. This indicated editorial curation and predictable navigation, but reduced exposure to diverse content.  

3. **The Rise and Fall of "Box Sets"**:  
   Longitudinal analysis showed a peak and decline in the prominence of "box sets," suggesting an editorial shift toward a more diverse content mix (aligning more closely with core public service values).
