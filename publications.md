### 1. 'Recommended for you': A distant reading of BBC iPlayer

**Author:** JP Kelly

**Journal:** *Critical Studies in Television*

**Year:** 2021

**Abstract:**
This sole-authored paper undertakes a 'distant reading' of the BBC iPlayer interface using the longitudinal dataset compiled for this project. It moves beyond close textual analysis of individual programmes to identify broader patterns in the platform's architecture and content prioritisation.

**Key Findings:**
- ðŸ“Œ **Decline of Channel Branding:** The study observed a significant decrease in the prominence of traditional BBC channel branding on the iPlayer landing page over the study period. This suggests a shift towards a more platform-centric approach to content curation, de-emphasizing linear broadcast affiliations.
- ðŸ“Œ **Editorial Curation:** Analysis of the data revealed a pattern of consistent content placement, suggesting that there is still a high degree of editorial control over the BBC iPlayer interface.
- ðŸ“Œ **Platform vs Channel Identity:** The findings contribute to understanding the evolving identity of public service media VoD platforms as they navigate the tension between their broadcast heritage and the demands of on-demand consumption.

### 2. "What's on the interface tonight?" A longitudinal analysis of the publishing strategies of public service video-on-demand platforms in the UK and Denmark

**Authors:** JP Kelly & Jannick Kirk SÃ¸rensen

**Journal:**
This co-authored study compares the publishing strategies of public service VoD platforms in the UK (BBC iPlayer) and Denmark (DRTV). Utilizing longitudinal interface data, the research examines how these platforms present content to their audiences, considering factors like genre prominence, editorial selections, and platform-specific features.

**Key Findings (Specific to BBC iPlayer):**
- ðŸ“Œ **Strategic Genre Placement:** The analysis of the iPlayer interface revealed consistent placement patterns for specific genres (e.g., Film, Sport) in prominent rows. This indicates a level of editorial curation and predictable navigation, which can both guide users and potentially limit exposure to a wider range of content.
- ðŸ“Œ **Thematic Carousels and Editorial Focus:** The study identified the use of thematic carousels and editorial selections as key strategies for highlighting specific content and responding to cultural events or strategic priorities.
- ðŸ“Œ **Cross-National Comparison:** While focusing on iPlayer's strategies, the paper also highlights differences in approach compared to DRTV, providing a broader understanding of public service media's online content presentation.
