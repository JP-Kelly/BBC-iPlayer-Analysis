# ðŸ“Š Visualisations

This page showcases some of my data visualisations created using Tableau.

These visualisations explored trends such as content availability and prominence, branding and channel affiliation, frequency of box sets, and genre distribution on the BBC iPlayer platform.

### Visualisation 1: Analysis of Box Sets Over Time

![1 iPlayer Analysis - Analysis of Boxsets](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/534d754b-5497-4f0f-8356-93534a2a992b)


ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** This visualisation shows the frequency of **Box Sets** by genre, channel, month, and day of the week. The visualisation highlights a number of interesting patterns. For instance, it reveals that comedy is the genre with the highest number of Box Sets. Another key insight is that Box Sets are far more prevalent during summer months. The summer increase in Box Sets might be related to seasonal viewing patterns, with people having more free time for extended viewing.

### Visualisation 2: The Rise and Fall of Box Sets

ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** Taking a longitudinal approach, this chart illustrates the trend in Box Set popularity throughout the sample period, demonstrating a pattern of growth and subsequent decrease. This trend likely reflects a strategic editorial shift away from Box Sets to promote a wider range of genres and encourage content discovery, aligning more closely with core public service values.

ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** This visualisation provides a breakdown of genre by day of the week. It demonstrates that comedy is the most common genre on all days of the week.

### Visualisation 4: Popularity of Genre (by Month)


![4 iPlayer Analysis - Genre popularity (month)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8b314fc-a7fa-43f3-a493-c25938e8507a)


ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** This visualisation breaks down genre frequency by month and reveals greater variability compared to the daily view (see visualisation above). For example, comedy is significantly more popular in some months (e.g., Jan, Feb, Dec) but only marginally more popular in others (e.g., July, Sept, Oct, Nov).

### Visualisation 5: Genre Prominence in Interface


![5 iPlayer Analysis - Genre position](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad101200-8d72-41c4-a411-dc56caefddcc)


ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** This visualisation illustrates the average positioning of genres within the interface, where prominence increases towards the top-left (the area initially visible to users). The analysis reveals that some genres exhibit low prominence, appearing lower and/or further to the right (e.g., Sport, CBBC, CBeebies). This suggests a strategic decision by the BBC to ensure that certain genres have greater prominence over others.

### Visualisation 6: Channel Prominence in Interface


![6 iPlayer Analysis - Channel position](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a48e47b6-1435-4984-891c-2c8286d56af0)


ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** Similar to the genre prominence visualisation above, this visualisation displays the average interface position, but for channels instead of genres. Channels positioned higher and to the left are more prominent. The analysis reveals that some channels / brands are consistently placed in less prominent positions (e.g., BBC World News, BBC Alba, BBC Teach). This finding raises the possibility of a strategic editorial decision to allocate less prominent interface positions to channels with a stronger public service portfolio (e.g., BBC World News, BBC Alba). This prioritisation could have implications for the audience reach and impact of these channels.

### Visualisation 7: The Rise of Channel Agnosticism


![7 iPlayer Analysis - Channel Branding](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dd73cfb-9c41-4e1f-b170-9cc1457451f1)


ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** This visualisation illustrates the increasing prominence of unbranded/unaffiliated content. Initially, content within the interface was predominantly channel-affiliated (e.g., BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three), but this branding has diminished over time. This suggests a strategic shift towards a more platform-agnostic approach to content presentation.
