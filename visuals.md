# ðŸ“Š Visualisations

This page showcases some of my data visualisations created using Tableau.

These visualisations explored trends such as content availability and prominence, branding and channel affiliation, frequency of box sets, and genre distribution on the BBC iPlayer platform.

### Visualisation 1: Analysis of Box Sets Over Time

ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** This visualisation shows the frequency of **Box Sets** by genre, channel, month, and day of the week. The visualisation highlights a number of interesting patterns. For instance, it reveals that comedy is the genre with the highest number of Box Sets. Another key insight is that Box Sets are far more prevalent during summer months. The summer increase in Box Sets might be related to seasonal viewing patterns, with people having more free time for extended viewing.

ðŸ’¡ **Analysis:** Taking a longitudinal approach, this chart illustrates the trend in Box Set popularity throughout the sample period, demonstrating a pattern of growth and subsequent decrease. This trend likely reflects a strategic editorial shift away from Box Sets to promote a wider range of genres and encourage content discovery, aligning more closely with core public service values.
